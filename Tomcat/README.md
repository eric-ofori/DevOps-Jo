### Linux File Hierarchy Structure:

1. / (Root): Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.

3. /boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd. 

4. /dev : Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null. These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.

5. /etc : Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

6. /home : Usersâ€™ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

7. /lib : Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.

8. /media : Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs 

9. /mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.

10. /opt : Optional application software packages. Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.

11. /sbin : Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.

12. /srv : Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and               repositories for version control systems.

13. /tmp : Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.

14. /usr : Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications. 

15. /proc : Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. Contains information about system process.
